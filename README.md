# React + Vite

This project was designed to meet the demand for inventory control. In which the browser's storage was used to store the data.

The project was developed in react, which is in its first version, which was focused on solving the need presented at first. We have a home page, which presents item data, such as diversity, total items stored, recent items and items with a low quantity in stock. We have a page with a table of items, where we can add new items and manage existing items.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
